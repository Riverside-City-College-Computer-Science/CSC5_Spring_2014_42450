Menu works, but ensure to enter appropriate inputs. 
	-Savitch Chp3 Prb 8 - Blackjack will not work with menu. Adding cstdlib to menu
        creates an error with char exit, in global constants. It will work fine on its
        own 

        -Savitch Chp3 Prb10 - Does not work. I am not trying to get credit for it,
        but I would like to learn how to solve it.
